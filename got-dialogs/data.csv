My husband, the late Lord Luthor._He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking._They say he was looking up at the sky_and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him._And now my son is doing the same,_only this time he's riding a lion instead of a horse._Now..._I want you to tell me the truth_about this royal boy, this Joffrey._I... I..._You, you. Who else would know better?_We've heard some troubling tales. Is there any truth to them?_Has this boy mistreated you? Has he ripped out your tongue?_King Joffrey, His Grace is very fair and handsome_and as brave as a lion._Yes, all Lannisters are lions._And when a Tyrell farts, it smells like a rose._But how kind is he? How clever?_Has he a good heart, a gentle hand?_I'm to be his wife. I only want to know what that means._Bring me some cheese._Cheese will be served after the cakes, my lady._The cheese will be served when I want it served._I want it served now._Are you frightened, child? No need for that._We're only women here. Tell us the truth. No harm will come to you._My father always told the truth._Yes, he had that reputation. And they named him traitor and took his head._Joffrey._Joffrey did that._He promised he would be merciful_and he cut my father's head off._And he said that was mercy._Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it._Go on._I can't. I never meant..._My father was a traitor._My brother as well. I have traitor's blood._Please don't make me say any more._She's terrified, Grandmother. Look at her._Speak freely, child._We would never betray your confidence, I swear it._He's a monster._Ah._That's a pity._Please, don't stop the wedding._Have no fear. The Lord Oaf of Highgarden_is determined that Margaery shall be queen._Even so, we thank you for the truth._Ah._Here comes my cheese._We're at war. This march is a distraction._My grandfather's funeral is not a distraction._Are we riding to battle at Riverrun?_No._Then it's a distraction._My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there._We need his men._Unless he's been breeding them,_he don't have enough to make a difference._Have you lost faith in our cause?_If it's revenge, I still got faith in it._If you no longer believe..._I can believe till it snows in Dorne._Don't change the fact that we've got half the men._You don't think we can win?_May I speak my mind, Your Grace?_Have you not been speaking your mind, Lord Karstark?_I think you lost this war the day you married her._Whoa! Whoa!_Your Grace._You're afraid of her._And she knows it._I'm not afraid of her._May I help you, Lady Stark?_No._I'm sorry, I shouldn't have..._You can't help because a mother_makes one for her children to protect them._Only a mother can make them._You've made them before?_Twice._Did they work?_After a fashion._I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall._Many years before that, one of the boys came down with the pox._Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night, he'd live._But it would be a very long night._So I sat with him all through the darkness._Listened to his ragged little breaths._His coughing, his whimpering._Which boy?_Jon Snow._When my husband brought that baby home from the war, I couldn't bear to look at him._I didn't want to see those brown_stranger's eyes staring up at me._So I prayed to the Gods, take him away. Make him die._He got the pox._And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived._A murderer._I'd condemned this poor, innocent child to a horrible death_all because I was jealous of his mother._A woman he didn't even know._So I prayed to all seven Gods,_let the boy live._Let him live and I'll love him._I'll be a mother to him._I'll beg my husband to give him a true name,_to call him Stark and be done with it,_to make him one of us._And he lived._And he lived._And I couldn't keep my promise._And everything that's happened since then,_all this horror that's come to my family,_it's all because I couldn't love a motherless child._Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand?_Yes._You liked him?_I like you, but if you're playing us false,_it won't be hard for me to kill you._I've got wildling blood in my veins. These are my people._I understand._Well, how could you understand?_You want to protect your people._Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans,_half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another?_They speak seven different languages in my army._The Thenns hate the Hornfoots. The Hornfoots hate the ice-river clans._Everyone hates the cave people._So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants_to march together in the same army?_No._I told them we were all going to die if we don't get south._Because that's the truth._Shouldn't be long now._What's wrong with him?_He's a warg._He can enter the mind of animals, see through their eyes._He's scouting for us._What, you've never met a warg?_Orell._Where were you this time?_The Fist of the First Men._What did you see?_Dead crows._What's the matter, Piggy? You crying 'cause you're cold?_There's 200 brothers killed by dead men_and you're still here_whimpering._That seem fair to you?_I seen 'em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole._Why don't you lie down and rest for a while, eh?_You know you want to._Hey._Get up, Sam._No._Get up._I can't._If you stop, you'll die._'Course if you don't stop, you'll probably die, too._You don't care._'Course we care._You left me._When the White Walkers came, you left me._Aye, we left you. You're fat and you're slow._We didn't want to die._Help me get him up._Looks like that piggy is done for._Help us get him up._He's slowing us down._Just get him up!_Why? So the rest of us can die?_We'll move faster without him._What is this? Get up, Tarly._Is he all right?_Aye, I think so._- We may as well just go without him. - That's enough._Tarly, I forbid you to die._Do you hear me?_Why should the rest of us..._Rast, you're responsible for him._What am I supposed to do?_Make sure he gets back alive._If he doesn't, you don't._Move on!_I'm not dying for you, Piggy. You hear me?_Where's Rickon and Hodor?_Looking for food._What's out there?_Not another step, boy. Unless you want to drown in your own blood._I'm unarmed._That was poor planning._My sister carries the weapons._I'm better with them._Drop the spear._Drop it._If you kill me, that wolf will tear you to bits._You must be Summer._I'm Jojen Reed. This is my sister, Meera._We've come a long way to find you, Brandon._And we have much farther to go._I'm just trying to understand._Would you please shut up about it?_Jaqen H'ghar offered you three kills._I'm not listening._But just explain it to me._He offered to kill any three people you wanted. Dead._All you had to do was give him the names. Anyone._You could have picked King Joffrey._Shut up._You could have picked Tywin Lannister._Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal, so why are you complaining?_But you could have ended the war._Where are we going?_North._We should have come to the Red Fork River by now._Maybe we passed it._It's 100 feet wide. How could we have passed it?_If we hit the Red Fork, we can follow it west to Riverrun._My mother grew up there. My grandfather's a lord. He'll protect us._could be a minstrel. - Shut up._A minstrel's got gold sometimes._We could jump him, tie him up, steal his gold, and buy some food._Shh!_And so he spoke, and so he spoke_That lord of Castamere_But now the rains weep o'er his hall_With no one there to hear_What's lurking behind that wall? A lion? A wolf?_Just a dirty little cub, I think._- Loose a few more shafts. - Don't._Put the sword down, girl._You go on down the road. Keep singing so we know where you are._Leave us be and I won't kill you._Generous._You're a dangerous person._I like dangerous people._Why are your friends so shy?_What friends?_The fat one to your left and the lad beside him._Three young ones on the run carrying castle-forged swords._You escape from Harrenhal?_Who are you?_Thoros of Myr._The fellow with the bow is Anguy._No, who do you fight for?_The Brotherhood Without Banners._Now come along._I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal._I'm not going with them.

We'll talk more over brown bread and stew._And then you can go on your way._Here's the thing, fat boy._When I'm done talking, that arrow's falling down on your fat head._So I advise you move, because I'm done talking._Half the country's starving and look at this one._Maybe he's the reason half the country's starving._My lion._We've spoken of this._You cannot come here._But you said I should come to you with any problems._Did anyone see you?_No. - you sure?_My father does not make idle threats._Having you killed would be the high point of his week._You have to be absolutely certain._All right. What is this problem?_I'm worried about Sansa._When she spoke with Lord Baelish,_his friend warned me about him._Baelish doesn't have friends._I don't know her name._Oh, Ros? The redhead?_How do you know her?_I try to know as many people as I can._You never know which one you'll need._She's a whore._Yes, well, we shouldn't be judgemental about these things._You fucked her._Oh, please._All right, yes, I fucked her once._Twice._But since I met you, my lady, I've been with no one else._And was she good? Did you like her?_Not as much as I like you, obviously,_or she'd be the one torturing me right now._What did she say about Littlefinger?_That Sansa shouldn't trust him._Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger?_We have to protect her._We can't._Now that the Lannisters have discarded her, Sansa will have many suitors._A great beauty with a very old name._A great beauty? Oh, a great beauty?_Yes, she is, objectively, very._Her face is quite pleasing, to other men and to women,_people in general._But not to me, of course._I only have eyes for you._You pervert. You want her?_This child?_I don't even want to talk about her._But you are._Only because you're making me._I didn't force you to open_your mouth and make words come out._This is cruel and unfair. Cruelly unfair._Aw! ""The cruelty. Shae is so cruel to me.""_Mmm.

Good._How are you finding life in the capital?_It must be quite a change after Renly's camp._A welcome one._A military encampment is no place for a lady._And the bedside of a traitor?_Is that a place for a lady?_Your Grace,_I tried to do my duty as a wife, that is all._What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it?_The duty of any wife to any husband. To provide him with children._You failed to do this._Why? - I..._I would not speak ill of the dead._You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor_'cause he had a sword put through his heart?_No. I do beg your pardon._The subtleties of politics are often lost on me._Renly..._I don't believe he was interested in the company of women._What makes you say this?_Whenever I wanted to make a child with him, he..._He had so many excuses, so many late-night war councils._He never wanted to try._Except one evening,_after he'd had far too much wine to drink, he suggested something..._Something that sounded very painful_and couldn't possibly result in children._Maybe the fault was with me._No, he was a known degenerate._It's such a relief to hear you say so, Your Grace._Mmm._I've considered making his perversion punishable by death._As is your right._You must do whatever you need to do._You are the king._Yes._I am._Do you like it?_I just had it made. Probably one of_the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms._It's beautiful. Will you show me how it works?_It's a new design. Much easier to load. There's no crank._You use this lever to draw the string._The bolt goes here._And then you just aim..._And..._Would you take me hunting sometime?_Forgive me, Your Grace. I know a hunt is no place for a woman._It's not unheard of._My father would never let me before..._You no longer belong to him._Do you want to hold it?_May I? Please._I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here_and watch something die over there._Could you do it?_Could you kill something?_I don't know, Your Grace.

Stop!_Tell us the truth._About what?_I don't know what you want._I want the truth._What truth?_Why'd you take Winterfell?_I took it to... I took it..._who gave the orders? - No one._I took it on my own. - Why?_To take the North while vulnerable._And once you took it?_Hold it. Rule it._Good. That's very good._Why did you do that? I told you._Why did you take Winterfell?_I took it to bring glory to my house and my father._Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I took it because I hated the Starks._I hated them for holding me prisoner. I wanted to hurt them._What are you doing?_Please._I'll tell you anything. Just take it off._Please. Please, just take it off._your sister sent me. - Yara?_I'll come for you tonight when the castle sleeps._No, don't go. Please, please. No, please don't leave me._Please, please. Please, please don't go!_Please. Please. Don't leave me._Please don't go._Rickon, stay with us._It's all right. The wolves will protect him._You can get inside his head, see through his eyes._Only when I'm asleep._That's how it begins until you learn to control it._You're a warg._It's not just wolves. Sometimes in my dreams there's a..._A three-eyed raven?_You've seen it?_We saw him together. You haven't forgotten?_Does it have anything to do with warging?_No, the raven is something different, something deeper._The raven brings the sight._Seeing things that haven't happened yet?_Or things that happened long before you were born_or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away._What's he telling him?_Why don't you ask?_Isn't he ashamed, your brother, needing you to protect him?_Where's the shame in that?_Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him_is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting._Some people will always need help._That doesn't mean they're not worth helping._When my father died, I dreamt it._You didn't dream it. You saw it. So did I._You have the sight, too?_When I told my father about your father,_for the first time in my life, I saw him cry._Your father is Howland Reed?_Yeah._He saved my father's life during the rebellion._Your father told you about the rebellion?_Mine never did. But I saw that, too._What else have you seen?_Only one thing that matters,_you._I never liked the skinny ones. Like drinking from a puddle._Not that I'm averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again._I don't drink ale._There's no story so good a drink won't make it better._- Yeah! - You see?_They've suffered through my bouts of_sobriety. It's very tedious for all concerned._Now, how did three children..._We're not children._How did three young persons such as yourselves,_untrained in the art of war, escape from Harrenhal?_Gendry's a smith. He was apprenticed in the armoury._A smith, eh? Where'd you train?_King's Landing. Tobho Mott's shop._That criminal. He charges twice as much_as every other armourer in the city._- That's because he's twice as good. - Ah-ha!_A smith and a salesman._- Gendry stole us weapons. - Ah!_Fought your way out of Harrenhal, I see._He knows how to use a sword and so do I._My brothers taught me._Ooh!_To your brothers!_You can finish your meals before you go._It may be awhile before you see another._You'll free us?_I gave you my word._But before you go,_allow me to raise a cup to your..._Hey, hey._Now that is an uncommonly large person._How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person?_One waits for him to drink until he passes out._Poor man. You have my sympathy._Aha!_Not a man at all._A Hound!_So good to see you again, Clegane._Thoros?_The fuck you doing here?_Drinking and talking too much. Same as ever._A pretty prize, lads._Yeah!_Girl._What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch?_It's a tough decision._Take the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water._Silence._Anyone can see us on the bridge,_but cross by water and the current could take us._Or I could escape down the river._Good luck._It's wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas._Which will she choose?_Gambler at heart. Wouldn't have guessed._Be quick about it._Oh, I need to rest. - Get up._I have these, on your feet when you walk too far._What Do you call them? - Get up now._Corns. I never used to get corns._I used to ride everywhere, not march around like a common foot soldier_wearing the same shit boots for over a year._This heel is ruined. There's no way..._I never understood why some knights_felt the need to carry two swords._Ooh!_You move well_for a great beast of a woman._You shouldn't grimace before you lunge. It gives away the game._Bit of a quandary for you. If you kill me, you fail Lady Stark._But if you don't kill me,_I'm going to kill you._You're good. Graceless, but good._See? If you were willing to hurt me, you might have had me there._Looks like your woman's getting the better of you,_if you can call that a woman._We enjoy a good fight. Gets our juices flowing._The Flayed Man of House Bolton. A bit gruesome for my taste._You sure he's the one?_That's him, all right._I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Frey's wedding._Give the man his silver._Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want._Enough to buy me a new head?"
